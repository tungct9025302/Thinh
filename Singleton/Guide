Must do: hide the constructor and implement a static creation method.
How to do it?
1. Use private,static for constructors in which class you want to create singleton, and then create a get instance method for it (this is the only way to access in this class) (This class could be final)
2. The demo class will call the constructor of the (1) class through the get instance method
