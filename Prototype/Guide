Use when: When your objects have dozens of fields and hundreds of possible configurations, cloning them might serve as an alternative to subclassing.
Components:Classes(extends) an abstract class,demo
How to do it?
- Make an abstract class that is extended by many subclasses(Subclass must have more details than).The abstract class must have a clone abstract method,and will cotains common variables,a constructor and a detailed constructor to define which subclasses will be chosen and also define the previous variables
- The classes that extend will be the same like the abstract class, but it will have its own vars and constructors as also define clone method where it will return.
-The demo will contain  the constructors of classes that extend and give specific numbers for each var in parent class.


Tóm tắt:  nhiều class con mở rộng cho 1 class mẹ/class mẹ có gì class con có đó...thay đổi tất cả trừ abstract method.
